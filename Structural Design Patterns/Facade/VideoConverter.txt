In this example, the Facade pattern simplifies interaction with a complex video conversion framework.
Instead of making your code work with dozens of the framework classes directly, you create a facade class which 
encapsulates that functionality and hides it from the rest of the code. This structure also helps you to minimize the 
effort  of upgrading to future versions of the framework or replacinng it with another one. The only thing you'd need to 
change in your app would be the implementation of the facade's methods.

// These are some classes of a complex 3rd-party video conversion framework. We don't control that code, therefore
// can't simplify it.
